Thank you for following our Github.

This branch is mainly for the development of the CouchDB side of FiveM.
In here we will be trying to make FiveM + all mods we are creating and or using (Permissions will be asked before commiting) to work with CouchDB

For those who are not in to the coding department, and just would like to have a server to run without the hassle, we will be trying to provide you with all the means.

Hopefully this will be a fruitful colaboration with many modders and committers.

Sincerly:
